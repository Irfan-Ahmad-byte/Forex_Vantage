## Welcome to Forex_Vantage

In this section I will use Alpha Vantage API to analyze forex data. Let's first import some required libraries. To use any API we are generally required to pass an API key with the search parameters. So, for AlphaVantageAPI we can get one from [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/). In this approach I'll rather use a library by [RomellTorres](https://github.com/RomelTorres/alpha_vantage) to explore the [AlphaVantageAPI](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/), and not the API site.
Let's begin.

```
import pandas as pd        #for dataframe visualization
from alpha_vantage.foreignexchange import ForeignExchange as FX    #library to use AlphaVantageAPI without link requests
```
* The alpha_vantage Library is the library I'm going to use to interact with Alpha Vantage API. Full documentation is available at [https://github.com/RomelTorres/alpha_vantage].

`APIkey = 'ABC'`

* We'll replace 'ABC' with our API key
